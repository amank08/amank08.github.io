                <h3><a href="https://www.apple.com/">Apple</a></h3>
                <p>The apple website is designed to have clean aesthetic and is supposed to give off the idea of sophistication like in their products. It also has an intuitive user experience and allows users to quickly navigate their products.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>C - Contrast: Keeps a simple dark gray and white color scheme giving the website a strong contrast. There is a clear difference between the content and the nav bars.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>R - Repetition: Uses a similar structure across all pages keeping all elements consistent. The styling and theme is consistent across all pages as well.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>A - Alignment: All Elements within the website are broken up into grids and are consistently aligned, creating a clean and organized design. </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>P - Proximity: Groups related elements together and makes good use of white space as well. There is a logical flow of information.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>
            <section class="eval">
                <h3><a href="https://charlotte.craigslist.org/">Criagslist</a></h3>
                <p>The criagslist is designed to have straightforward and minimilist style. While some people might prefer a focus on functionality rather than aesthetics, the lack of visuals or a color scheme makes it look plain and dated to many users</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>C - Contrast: Lack of a color scheme, images, or difference in font size creates minimal contrast. It's harder to distinguish between important information and less important information.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>R - Repetition: There is repetition between elements on the main page but there is no consistency across the different pages. Some have pictures and some don't which can be confusing for the user</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>A - Alignment: Elements aren't aligned very well especially when you click on one of the listings. The postings are aligned strongly to the left while the right of the page isn't even used.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>P - Proximity: There is lot of unused space across all pages while some areas are cluttered, making it overall very difficult to read.</li>
